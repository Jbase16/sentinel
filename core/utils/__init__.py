"""Module __init__: inline documentation for /Users/jason/Developer/sentinelforge/core/utils/__init__.py."""
#
# PURPOSE:
# Provides shared utility functions used across the entire codebase.
# Think of this as a toolbox of commonly needed helper functions.
#
# KEY MODULES:
# - **observer.py**: Observer/Signal pattern implementation (pub/sub events)
# - **async_helpers.py**: Async/await helper functions
#
# COMMON PATTERNS:
# - **Observer Pattern**: Objects can subscribe to events and get notified
# - **Async Utilities**: Helpers for working with async/await code
# - **Decorators**: Function wrappers that add functionality
#
# WHY UTILITIES:
# - **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself (write once, use everywhere)
# - **Consistency**: Same pattern used throughout codebase
# - **Tested**: Utilities are well-tested so bugs don't propagate
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - **Observer Pattern**: Pub/sub system where objects emit signals and others listen
# - **Async/Await**: Modern Python concurrency model
# - **Decorators**: @function_wrapper syntax that modifies function behavior
#
